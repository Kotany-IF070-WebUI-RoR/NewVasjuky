// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js,
// which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts,
// vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or any plugin's vendor/assets/javascripts directory can be referenced here
// using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear
// at the bottom of the
// compiled file. JavaScript code in this file should be added after the last
// require_* statement.

// Read Sprockets README
//(https://github.com/rails/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
